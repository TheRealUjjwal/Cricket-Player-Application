The Cricket Player Application is a Java Full Stack Web Development project developed by a group of four members from scratch. This application can be used to retrieve any information of a cricket player along with his/her complete bio. It also consists of a Login page where one can create its own free account and can also add any number of players to his/her Favorite list such that next time he/she will get Recommendations also based on their Favorite list.
